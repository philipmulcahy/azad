## Headline
Item ASIN, Item Quantity and scraping only the most recent 1, 2 or 3 months are
now free to use for all, as the £5000 charity target has been reached:
see https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/azad-pah

Commercial features batch 2 (shipments, delivery status etc),
is behind the subscription paywall.
Existing subscribers have access to these features without further payment
(for remainder of their subscription period).

UPDATE 2023-09-07
v1.9.31 went live today, including shipment/tracking information.

UPDATE 2023-08-19
Commercial features batch 1 (ASIN, 1/2/3 months) is about to be unrestricted.

UPDATE 2023-06-07
Because the climb to £5000 is going slowly (thank you to everyone who has
kindly donated!), I am exploring building a paid-for preview version. The money
paid will still go to the same Princess Alice charity campaign (less whatever
handling fee is charged by the platform I select) - e.g. I am still working for
free. V1.9.26 (rolling out in the week of 2023-06-07) has the subscription
option. When the £5000 goal is reached, everyone gets the held back features
above.

## Rationale

These features are primarily of interest to commercial users such as drop
shippers and purchasing departments of companies. Such commercial users have
not been reticent in asking for me to add these (and other) capabilities.

Princess Alice Hospice (PAH) is a charity funded end-of-life care facility. I
ask users who benefit from AZAD to donate to PAH using
[this link](https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/azad-pah/donate), instead of
rewarding me. I have a day job and cannot accept compensation for out-of-hours
work.

As I write this note in April 2023, the lifetime total raised by AZAD for PAH
is £3306 (that's roughly USD 4100).

The value of the time I have invested in AZAD vastly exceeds this amount, and
while I cannot be sure, it seems reasonable to suppose the value various
businesses have derived from using it also much bigger.

## Survey Results:

In 2022, I put out a survey asking for commercial users to vote on what
features they would find most valuable.

			Yelp Handoff Tool
		</h1>
		<p style="margin-left:5%">
			This extension (only deployed at Yelp) will only store data in Confluence.<br/><br/>
			It also has (at your command) the ability to send e-mail to your team mates.<br/><br/>
			It obtains some of this data from you (the messages and groupings you construct using the extension), and some of it from Pagerduty incident queries.<br/><br/>

		</h1>
		<p style="margin-left:5%">
			This extension is able to query various Amazon shopping sites on your behalf.<br/><br/>
			It only works when you have a tab open on one the Amazon sites and you are logged on.<br/><br/>
			It does not share information about you or your Amazon accounts with anyone.<br/><br/>
			It caches some of the data locally on your browser to accelerate performance.<br/><br/>
<br/>
			The option for "save order debug info" includes everything shown on the Orders page, Details Page, and Invoice page, which will show not only info about that order, but may also show info about other orders and recommendations.<br/><br/>
			Shipping and billing addresses are also included. When sent, this info may be used by developers to improve the extension; it will not be intentionally made available to others.<br/><br/>
<br/>
			Source code is available at <a href="https://github.com/philipmulcahy/azad">GitHub</a> for your inspection.<br/><br/>
